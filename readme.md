# Estimating Eye Gaze Direction Using FARE-Net Model and Enlighten GAN
This is a source code of a study about improving FARE-Net model performance on estimating gaze direction in dark environtment by enhance the dataset image with EnlightenGAN.

## Research Result

After enhanced the original MPIIGaze image dataset, the FARE-Net model accuracy was increased around 14% compared to the original MPIIGaze dataset.

The researcher also validate the model for each subject and found that the accuracy improvement not happen on all subject.


## This repo contain:
- Code to organize the  MPIIGaze & MPIIFaceGaze dataset that will be used in the project
- Code to create new enhanced dataset from original dataset
- Code to train the FARE-Net model
- Model implementation code example

<!-- ## How to run:
1. Install the required depedencies -->
